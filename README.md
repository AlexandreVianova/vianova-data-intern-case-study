# Case study


We want to know the _population that lives in a Megapole in each country_

The list of cities in the world, with their population can be found  at :
https://public.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/geonames-all-cities-with-a-population-1000/export/?disjunctive.cou_name_en

The purpose of this exercice is to evaluate your skills in Python and SQL. You'll have to fork this repository and write a program that fetch the [dataset of the population of all cities in the world](https://public.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/geonames-all-cities-with-a-population-1000/export/?disjunctive.cou_name_en), stores it in a database, then perform a query that will compute for each country the number of people that live in a city of more than 500,000 inhabitants. The result will be saved as a tabulated separated value file. 
Please send us the link to your github repository with the answer of the exercise.
